"""Normalized Context Representation (NCR) — the intermediate every adapter maps into.

Per eval_harness/INTERFACE.md the format isn't the moat: every source (ACF, dbt docs,
raw markdown, …) collapses to this, and the delta is computed on it. Kept deliberately
small: the runner needs the seeds (ground truth) and a per-domain context blob to inject
for the context-on condition.
