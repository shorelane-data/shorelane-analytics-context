# Analytics Context Format (ACF) — v0.1

The on-disk format the interview produces and the harness reads. It is plain
Markdown + YAML in a git repo, so the review surface is a pull request and the
change-trigger is a GitHub Action.

ACF deliberately separates **three audiences**:

| File kind | Written for | Optimized for |
|---|---|---|
| `context.md`, `overview.md`, `terminology.md` | humans | onboarding, narrative, "why" |
| `reference.md` | the agent at query time | retrieval: routing triggers, gotchas, grain, query patterns |
| `*.yaml` (entities, metrics, domain) | both + CI | machine-validatable structured facts |

This split is the main upgrade over a single narrative doc. The `reference.md` is
the file the agent actually reads to answer a question, and it is written for an
LLM, not a person — explicit `IF … DO NOT …` routing, grain, exclusions, and
wrong-answer modes, with no prose it has to wade through.

## Design rules (these are load-bearing)

1. **A human owns every definition.** The model may draft; a person confirms. Any
   field marked `status: draft` is excluded from the "perfect" eval baseline until
   confirmed.
2. **No statistics in context.** Notes are qualitative business logic ("exclude
   BHPN — different reimbursement cycle"), never "~37% of sessions." Numbers go
   stale; business logic doesn't. 
3. **Context is separate from lineage, but never *unlinked* from it.** Every
   domain, entity, and metric carries a `lineage:` pointer (repo + path + ref) so
   drift detection can fire when the upstream model changes. Separation is for
   enterprises with many pipelines; the pointer is what keeps separation safe.
4. **Every confirmed disambiguation emits an eval seed.** The interview writes
   `evals/seeds/*.yaml` as a byproduct. These are the ground truth the delta is
   measured against.
5. **Everything is CI-checkable.** Each YAML kind has a JSON Schema in `schemas/`.
   A PR that breaks the schema fails review.

## Query patterns — the one narrow allowance for SQL in context

Context files carry business logic, not a query library — but a domain's
`reference.md` MAY include a small `## Common query patterns` section with fenced
`sql` blocks, **only where the exact query form is the hard-won knowledge**: the
join path, dedup, or mandatory clause that makes the obvious query silently wrong.
(Distilled, curated patterns are the useful residue of query history; raw query
retrieval, measured head-to-head, moves accuracy by less than a point. The pattern
is curation, not history.)

The line, precisely:

- **Pattern, not paste.** Real model/column names are welcome — they are already
  context. Literal parameter values are not: use `<placeholders>`. A pattern
  encodes a *form*; it is never a complete runnable report.
- **Each pattern names the failure it prevents** in one leading `Without this:`
  line. If no wrong-answer mode can be named, it is an example, not a pattern —
  leave it out.
- **Human-confirmed, like everything else** (design rule 1). Unconfirmed patterns
  carry `<!-- status: draft -->` and are excluded like any other draft.
- **Bounded.** A handful per domain — this is not a query library. Runnable,
  blessed SQL lives only in the gitignored `evals/verified/` sidecar (below),
  never committed.
- **Distilled, never mined.** Never copied from query logs or history; a pattern
  earns its place through the interview or a Stage-5 verified match.
- **Drift-covered.** A pattern references only models listed in the domain's
  `lineage:`, so upstream drift re-flags it for re-confirmation with the rest of
  the domain. A one-line dialect note (e.g. divide-by-zero handling) may
  accompany a pattern when the trap is dialect-specific.

When a pattern encodes a *metric's measure*, the structured sibling is the
metric's `expression:` block in `metrics.yaml` (see "metric", below) — the
preferred, schema-checked home for the measure, its mandatory filters, and its
allowed dimensions. The `reference.md` pattern keeps the routing prose and the
`Without this:` failure line; the expression carries the deterministic form.

```

Placement rule — decide by what the entity **is**, not by how many domains use
it today:
**subject entity** (a business noun — customer, provider, channel, geography —
that lives in or belongs in a `dim_*` table, or would be shared the moment a
second domain existed) → `entities/<group>.yaml`; **domain-specific status/type**
(enumerated values of a column on one fact table, one owner — "active",
"churned", a collection status) → `domains/<domain>/entities.yaml`.
A single-domain repo still puts its subject entities in `entities/` — "spans
domains today" is never the test, because it can't fire until a second domain
exists. Consumers (including the Nodal platform index) discover `entities/`
first, so subject entities buried per-domain are slower to retrieve.

## Where a domain comes from

A domain in ACF maps to **how the company already thinks about a slice of the
business — usually a cluster of dashboards.** The interview discovers domains by
asking which dashboards exist and who owns them, then treats each coherent cluster
as a domain. This is why `domain.yaml` carries a `dashboards:` list: a dashboard
cluster is the unit of "a line of business or function," and it's also the richest
source of eval seeds (the questions those dashboards answer are real questions).

## File: `context.config.yaml` (the drift seam)

The one file that makes "context lives apart from lineage" safe. It maps each
domain to its upstream lineage source(s), so a change there can flag stale context.
See [`template/context.config.yaml`](./template/context.config.yaml).

**When the dbt repo gitignores `target/` (the norm):** drift's clone fallback can't
find a manifest on `main`. The recommended pattern is the sender workflow
([`template/dbt-repo/notify-context-repo.yml`](./template/dbt-repo/notify-context-repo.yml)),
which publishes the parsed `manifest.json` on a single-commit orphan `dbt-manifest`
branch in the dbt repo; the source entry then reads `ref: dbt-manifest`,
`manifest_path: manifest.json`. Inline dispatch payloads only work for manifests under
GitHub's ~64 KB payload cap — real manifests need the branch.

**Multiple warehouses / clouds.** The top-level `warehouse:` is the repo-wide
*default*. Each `lineage_sources` entry may carry its own `warehouse:` (snowflake |
bigquery | …) when a company's domains span platforms; an entry without one inherits
the default. A source's effective platform is `source.warehouse ?? top-level
warehouse`. There is **no per-domain warehouse field** — a domain's platform is
derived from whichever sources its `lineage:` references. A single domain whose
models live on two platforms simply lists one lineage entry per source (the array
already supports this); don't invent a federated marker. Drift detection must resolve
each source's platform by this rule and diff against that source's manifest/connection.

```yaml
version: 0.1
warehouse: snowflake            # default platform; per-source `warehouse:` overrides it
lineage_sources:
  - id: dbt_snowflake
    type: dbt                   # no `warehouse:` → inherits the default (snowflake)
    repo: github.com/acme/acme-dbt
    ref: main
    manifest_path: target/manifest.json
  - id: dbt_bq_marketing
    type: dbt
    warehouse: bigquery         # this source lives on BigQuery
    repo: github.com/acme/marketing-dbt
    ref: main
    manifest_path: target/manifest.json
domains:
  session-financials:
    lineage:
      - source: dbt_snowflake
        models: [fct_session_financials, dim_client, dim_provider]
    # drift fires when any listed model's column set or test set changes
  marketing-attribution:        # platform derived from the source → BigQuery

## YAML kinds (full field lists in `schemas/`)

### entity (`entities/*.yaml`, `domains/*/entities.yaml`)
`name`, `description`, `mappings` (column→value meaning), `analytical_notes`,
`important` (disambiguation), `lineage`, `status` (draft|confirmed).

### metric (`domains/*/metrics.yaml`)
`name`, `definition` (prose, human-owned), `grain`, `parameters` (what the user
must specify), `caveats`, `common_filters`, `expression` (optional deterministic
anchor, below), `lineage`, `status`.

**Deterministic anchor: `expression:`.** An optional per-metric block that makes
the "generic form" rule precise and schema-checkable — the compile target for
eval templates, reconciliation, and verification. It is *not* SQL and *not* a
dialect; it is the structured envelope around a generic-form measure:

- `measure` (required) — the aggregation expression over columns of the metric's
  `lineage:` models, e.g. `SUM(collected_amount) / SUM(allowed_amount)`. The
  pattern-not-paste rules ("Query patterns", above) apply verbatim:
  `<placeholders>` for parameter values, business-constant literals welcome, no
  statistics, never a runnable query. The FROM is the metric's `lineage:`, the
  WHERE is `mandatory_filters`, the GROUP BY is a subset of `allowed_dimensions`.
- `mandatory_filters` — filters without which the metric is *wrong* (vs.
  `common_filters`, which stays advisory prose). Structured objects
  `{field, op, value?, reason?}`; `reason` names the failure the filter prevents.
  `op` is an open string, not an enum — the working vocabulary is `=`, `!=`, `<`,
  `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `in`, `not_in`, `like`/`not_like`, `ilike`/`not_ilike`,
  `is_null`, `is_not_null`, `between`; `value` may carry generic-form expressions
  (e.g. `<as_of_date> - 45 days`).
- `allowed_dimensions` — column names (dotted `model.column` when ambiguous) the
  metric may be sliced by. Omitted = not yet enumerated; present = exhaustive for
  verified slicing.

A metric carrying an `expression:` MUST also state its `grain` and pin its
`lineage` (schema-enforced) — that is what keeps the anchor drift-covered. By
convention its lineage models are a subset of the domain's lineage in
`context.config.yaml`, so an upstream model change re-flags `metrics.yaml` for
re-confirmation. Like everything else, the expression is analyst-confirmed
(design rule 1): adding or editing one on a confirmed metric flips the metric
back to `status: draft` until re-confirmed.

### domain (`domains/*/domain.yaml`)
`name`, `summary`, `tables`, `grain`, `dashboards`, `owner`, `lineage`.

Each `dashboards[]` entry carries `name`, `owner`, `canonical_question`, and
optionally `url` and `tool` (the BI platform, e.g. `plotly`, `tableau`,
`metabase`). `url` + `tool` are what let Stage 5 verify against the dashboard
*itself* (the `dashboard-verify` skill reads it in the analyst's browser)
instead of asking the analyst to read numbers aloud — and they declare the
trusted surface precisely, so a redesigned or retired dashboard is detectable
drift rather than a silent mismatch against a prose description.

### eval seed (`evals/seeds/*.seed.yaml`)
`question`, `intent` (the disambiguated meaning), `ir` (optional structured
decomposition, below), `expected` (one of:
`semantic_entity` | `sql_shape` | `value_at_snapshot`), `provenance`
(`interview` | `dashboard` | `correction` | `generated`), `domain`, `status`, and
the optional `verified_query_file` (below). See
[`SPEC` of seeds](./schemas/evalseed.schema.json) and
[harvesting reference](./skills/context-interview/references/eval-seed-harvesting.md).

**The IR: seeds store structure, not just phrasing.** The optional `ir:` block
([`schemas/ir.schema.json`](./schemas/ir.schema.json)) records the question's
decomposition — `metric` (a name reference into that domain's `metrics.yaml`),
`dimensions`, `filters` (same `{field, op, value?, reason?}` shape as a metric
expression's `mandatory_filters`), `grain` (omitted = the metric's), and
`time_window`. It *complements* the other fields, never replaces them: `intent`
stays the human-readable disambiguation, `expected` stays the grading contract.
What the IR buys: coverage becomes exactly computable (a question is covered iff
its `ir.metric` resolves to an expression-bearing definition), eval templates
derive mechanically from definitions, and the disambiguator's production output
and the eval seed become the same object — one contract between routing and
evaluation. Staleness rule: evergreen seeds (`sql_shape`, `semantic_entity`) use
*relative* `time_window` tokens (`last_quarter`, `last_30_days`, `ytd`, …);
absolute `{start, end}` windows belong only on `value_at_snapshot` seeds, whose
`expected.as_of` already pins them to a date.

**Seeds are the one place a number is allowed — but the SQL is never committed.**
Design rule 2 ("no statistics in context") and the pattern-not-paste rule ("Query
patterns", above) govern *context files* — the things the agent reads at query time
(`reference.md`, `metrics.yaml`). A seed is the *ground-truth* layer, not context, so a
`value_at_snapshot` number is allowed in the seed YAML, pinned to an `as_of` date so
it can't masquerade as live truth. The blessed SQL, however, is **deliberately kept
out of git**: SQL goes stale fast and must not be cloneable from a published context
repo, so it lives in a local, gitignored sidecar (`evals/verified/<name>.sql`) and
the committed seed carries only a `verified_query_file` pointer to it.

`verified_query_file` is the relative path to that sidecar — the blessed read-only
SQL whose result the analyst confirmed against a trusted source (a dashboard). It is
written **only on a verified match** by Stage 5 live verification (below) and is the
reusable "answer key" for the seed; the harness reads it locally where present and
degrades to grading `value_at_snapshot` / `sql_shape` where it is absent.

## Live verification (Stage 5) and `evals/runs/`

The interview's [Stage 5](./skills/context-interview/references/live-verification.md)
answers each candidate question twice — once with context off, once on — against the
live warehouse, then has the analyst confirm the on-answer against their dashboard.
The dashboard's numbers are read either by the analyst aloud or — when a browser MCP
binding is available — by the
[dashboard-verify skill](./skills/dashboard-verify/SKILL.md), which reads the
dashboard in the analyst's own local browser and emits a tier-tagged capture
(values + filter state) under `evals/captures/<timestamp>/`, alongside a
`reconciliation.md` diffing capture against answers; the analyst still blesses
every value, with its extraction tier visible. A confirmed match upgrades the seed
to `provenance: dashboard`, `expected.kind: value_at_snapshot` (with `value` +
`as_of`) and writes the blessed SQL to the gitignored sidecar
`evals/verified/<name>.sql`, pointed to by the seed's `verified_query_file`. A
mismatch is harvested back into the domain's `reference.md` / `known-issues.md`
plus a `provenance: correction` seed. The per-answer agent traces under
`evals/runs/<timestamp>/` and the captures under `evals/captures/` are generated
output, not ACF, and are gitignored in a generated context repo; the durable
outputs are the seeds and the updated context files. One dashboard-verify artifact
IS committed: learned per-dashboard playbooks in `evals/playbooks/<slug>.md` —
replay recipes (selectors, completion conditions; no data values), maintained like
any other authored file.

## Versioning

ACF is versioned at the repo root (`context.config.yaml: version`). The harness
declares which ACF versions it supports. Breaking changes bump the minor while
v0.x, the major after 1.0.

## Relationship to other formats

ACF is **one** input to the measurement harness, not a prerequisite. The harness
also reads Kaelio `ktx` (`semantic-layer/*.yaml` + `wiki/*.md`), dbt
(`manifest.json` + `schema.yml` docs), raw markdown, and agent data-analysis
skills (`SKILL.md` + `references/`). See
[`eval_harness/INTERFACE.md`](./eval_harness/INTERFACE.md) for the normalized
intermediate representation all of these map into.
